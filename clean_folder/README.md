Many people have a folder called "Disassemble" on their desktop. As a general rule, this folder can never be disassembled manually. Therefore, for your convenience, this Python package was developed to parse this folder. This program checks the file extension (the last characters in the file name) and, depending on the extension, decides which category to assign the file to. The script takes one argument at startup - the name of the folder in which it will sort. It can be called anywhere on the system from the console with the clean-folder command. Then to sort the /user/Desktop/Junk folder, you need to run the script with the command clean-folder /user/Desktop/Junk
